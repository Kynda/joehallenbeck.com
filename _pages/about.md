About This Blog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This site is an "Anything and Nothing" blog. It is my home page. My portfolio
and resume. It is a place where I ramble on about my life, and all kinds of
oddball topics, hobbies, and side projects that pass by me through the year.

I am sure there are hundreds of poorly written blog posts out there telling
prospective writers to pick a niche and stick to it. This is not such a blog.

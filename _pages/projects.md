Software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Github][]
: My open-source repositories and contributions to open-source projects can be
found on my [Github][] <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> account.

[TimeKeeper][]
: A straightforward single-user time keeping application for tracking hourly
client work across multiple accounts and projects.

[Damasca][]: The Conflicted Kingdoms
: The eternal, never ending, infinite alpha, Zelda-style MMORPG. Stop by the
nearly-dead bulletin board. Listen to us rattle on about what random platform
the game will not be completed on next.

The [DropFramework][] PHP Micro-Framework 
: A micro-framework from back when building your own PHP micro-framework was the
thing-to-do.

[Jekyll Template][] for this Site
: And of course (sans posts), the template for this Jekyll site is available for
anyone's use.

Other Sites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bowlich's Land of Links][]
: A Shaarli instance hosting links to all the random articles that I've read and
thoguht well enough to bookmark (or merely liked the headline, and saved for
later reading). If you can stand my tastes, subscribe to the RSS feed. Set up
your own and let me know. Anything to not contribute to the Social Media sharing
frenzy.

The [Dreamscapes][] Webcomic (on permanent hiatus)
: Back in 2008, I started a series of short-lived webcomic projects. The last,
and perhaps longest running of those was _In The Sea of Nihilism_ which was a
surrealist fantasy comic that, with no real direction, lost steam as I
transitioned away from seasonal work.

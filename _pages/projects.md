### [Bowlich's Land of Links][]

A Shaarli instance hosting links to all the random articles that I've read and
thoguht well enough to bookmark (or merely liked the headline, and saved for
later reading). IF you can stand my tastes, subscribe to the RSS feed. Set up
your own and let me know. Anything to not contribute to the Social Media sharing
frenzy.

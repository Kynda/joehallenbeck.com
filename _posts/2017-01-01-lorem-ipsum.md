My experience in blogging indicates that without some statement of why the blog 
exists or what the blog will cover the blog will gradually sink into a
meandering journal of the authorâ€™s random thoughts. I know this, because I have
blogs filled with my random musings. Let this one be different. Let it focus
more on informing others rather than introspectively informing myself. What
might you find here in future entries?


* Announcements relating to my upcoming publications, current writings, and work.
* A highlight of my photographs and artwork
* Short essays on philosophy, travelogues, and art reviews

        __construct() {
        $this->property = true;
